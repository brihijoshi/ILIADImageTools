# ILIADTools
This is a part of the my Independent Project on Computer Music to develop Interdisciplinary Art tools with Prof. Timothy Scott Moyers Jr.

## Pre-work

1. _TO ADD_

## Week 1 -- 7th Jan to 13th Jan 2019

1. Searched for MIDI libraries compatible with Python
2. Came down to two - python-midi and Mido
3. Since Mido is more recently contributed to as compared to python-midi, started using that

### Setup for Mido

1. Use Audio MIDI setup in Mac to open ports
2. Use Sending code written in Python and use Mido to send it to one of the desired ports
3. Use MIDIIn in SuperCollider to receive the data

### TO-DO NEXT

1. Sanity testing of this code
2. Send longer streams of data, like Image pixel arrays

### Links Used
