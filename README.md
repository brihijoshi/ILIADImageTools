 ### _This work is developed as a Proof of Concept for my Independent Project with [Dr. Timothy Scott Moyers Jr.](http://www.timmoyers.com/)_.
 
 ILIAD - Interdisciplinary Lab for Interactive AV Development is developing a set of toolkits that can assist easy manipulation of DAW or Game Engine parameters using various kinds of data, like images, videos, CSVs. 
 
 ILIAD Image Tools provides a MIDI interface with an intuitive GUI, that uses image data to manipulate MIDI CC values. These MIDI CC values can then be used in a variety of MIDI Receivers (Game Engines, DAWs, etc) to control a wide vareity of parameters.
